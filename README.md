Reached out to AskBCS (T/A Angel) for assistance with sections "Calculate the total school budget and per capita spending per school" and "Calculate the average test scores per school".

Starter code in "Group by `school_name` and take the mean of the `math_score` column for each" and "Group by `school_name` and take the mean of the the `reading_score` column for each" each had ninth_grade and not ninth_grader, but tenth, eleventh, and twelf were each listed as "grader" so I adjusted the provided information to be more inline with the other information provided.
